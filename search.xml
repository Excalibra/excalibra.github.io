      <title><![CDATA[Three Ways to Manage Macs in a Business Environment]]></title>
      <url>/2025/01-22/01</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[While Macs are less common than Windows PCs, they have successfully entered the IT landscape of many enterprises. IT teams need to find solutions that integrate Macs with existing Windows Active Directory (AD) domains and determine the necessary tools or systems. Deciding how to integrate Macs into a Windows infrastructure is no simple task. Organisations need to clarify the number of Macs requiring support and the type of access required for existing tools and systems.Compared to Windows PCs, many employees prefer Macs. With the influx of iOS devices into businesses and Apple’s promise of seamless integration, the reality can often lead to unexpected challenges. Despite this, Macs maintain a place in predominantly Windows environments. Balancing support for Macs with protecting corporate assets and maintaining resource control, IT teams can achieve integration through three main approaches:  Integrating Macs into the AD domain using existing tools.  Using dedicated tools to manage Macs within the AD domain.  Managing Macs as standalone mobile devices.Three Ways to Manage Macs in a Business EnvironmentIntegrating Macs into the AD DomainMany IT administrators prefer seamlessly adding Macs to the AD environment alongside Windows desktops. To some extent, macOS supports this method, as Mac desktops and laptops include the necessary client components and standard directory services to join an AD domain.The process of binding a Mac to the domain is relatively straightforward, provided users have the required computer access and domain credentials. When a Mac joins the domain, Windows Server automatically creates a computer object in AD (unless one already exists), just like a Windows desktop.The latest versions of macOS make Apple devices easier to integrate, as macOS supports Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) and Exchange ActiveSync. SCCM now supports macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) and newer versions. However, Macs are not Windows desktops, and most management products are designed for Windows PCs. This can lead to compatibility issues. One way to mitigate these issues is by extending the AD schema to better accommodate Macs. However, this requires development resources and technical expertise, which can be challenging for organisations with limited Mac users.Fortunately, administrators can enhance existing tools by leveraging macOS commands. These commands allow IT teams to configure idle screen lock times, language settings, and disable autocorrection, among other functions.Using AD with Third-Party ToolsAlthough AD and macOS commands simplify integration, many administrators find it easier to use additional tools for management. For example:  Macs can be joined to an AD domain, while Apple Remote Desktop is used to send commands to Mac clients.  Alternatively, organisations can deploy macOS Server to manage Macs using Apple’s Profile Manager. This approach requires setting up an Open Directory domain alongside AD, allowing remote management. AD retains control over Windows and Open Directory/OS X servers, facilitating seamless communication between the two environments for shared files and printing services.If this approach proves challenging, consider third-party solutions like Centrify User Suite (Mac edition). Centrify allows IT teams to manage Macs using AD authentication infrastructure for centralised management, policy enforcement, and single sign-on.Another popular option is JAMF Software’s Casper Suite, a comprehensive endpoint management product that integrates with AD and Open Directory. Casper Suite supports every stage of the Mac management lifecycle, including device enrolment, software distribution, asset inventory, updates, and security settings.Using Microsoft tools to integrate Macs with AD is not the only option. Often, the most effective way to manage Macs is to treat them as Unix systems rather than Windows desktops. Outside of integration with existing infrastructure, Macs can be treated as a standalone device type.Managing Macs as Mobile DevicesSince macOS 7, Apple has adopted a Mobile Device Management (MDM) model, replacing traditional directory services. This allows administrators to manage Macs, iOS, and Android devices using the same tools.For example, macOS enables administrators to query a Mac’s iTunes account to check if the associated Apple ID has changed—similar to iOS device management. This ensures resources such as apps and books purchased through Apple’s Volume Purchasing Program are assigned to the correct user.Apple’s modern MDM framework also allows administrators to:  Initiate AirPlay sessions on managed devices.  Push enterprise apps and eBooks to Macs.  Take advantage of macOS Server’s enhanced platform capabilities for MDM.Users can register their Macs, and vendors can use an expanding array of application programming interfaces (APIs) to support third-party security and management solutions.By leveraging MDM, organisations can effectively manage Macs alongside other devices while maintaining security and operational efficiency.]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[The Right Approach to Managing Apple Devices in Enterprises — ABM]]></title>
      <url>/2025/01-22/01</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[With the development of mobile internet technology, more and more businesses are adopting mobile devices for their operations. Among the many choices available on the market, Apple’s iPhone, iPad, and MacBook have gained popularity due to their high-quality user experience and premium image. Do you know how to correctly procure Apple devices for business use? Most users don’t see this as an issue, as Apple devices are sold through physical stores or online shops. However, products sold through these retail channels are aimed at regular consumers. Apple also has a separate business sales channel, and the biggest difference between Apple devices for businesses and those for regular consumers is the enterprise management function called ABM (Apple Business Manager).Apple manages the use of its devices through Apple ID. Whether it’s for downloading apps or ensuring device security, Apple ID is essential. However, Apple ID is a personal account, and using it directly for company-issued devices can lead to several unexpected problems.Firstly, there is the issue of software procurement and installation. Commercial software used by businesses is typically purchased through official business channels, but Apple ID requires individual users to buy software through the App Store. This not only prevents the company from benefiting from bulk purchasing discounts, but also raises issues about software ownership. Software purchased using an employee’s personal Apple ID is linked to that employee’s account. If the employee leaves the company, it’s impossible to transfer ownership of the software to the business.Secondly, there’s the issue of device lifecycle management. When an employee leaves, they return the company device, but if they haven’t unlinked their Apple ID from the device, the new employee cannot register a new account. Some disgruntled employees may even lock the device. Unlocking Apple devices can be a hassle—you must prove to Apple that you own the device by providing the purchase receipt (with the device’s serial number).Thirdly, personal privacy is often overlooked. There was an instance where a company owner purchased a batch of iPads for office use and, for convenience and cost-saving, registered all the devices with his personal Apple ID. Software purchased from the App Store can be shared across multiple devices using the same Apple ID. However, Apple assumes these devices are for personal use, so it will synchronise other information, such as contacts, text messages, and photos, across all devices. The unfortunate consequences of this scenario are easy to imagine.In reality, Apple provides businesses with a solution called Managed Apple ID, which belongs to the company rather than an individual employee, solving the above-mentioned issues. The Managed Apple ID works alongside ABM (Apple Business Manager), which integrates Apple’s enterprise device registration system (DEP - Device Enrollment Program) and volume software purchase program (VPP - Volume Purchase Program).Centralised Management of Enterprise Devices:Each Apple device has a unique serial number. Devices purchased through Apple’s business sales channel are registered in the ABM system backend. Upon powering on the device, activation occurs automatically, and management control is transferred to the company’s designated MDM (Mobile Device Management) system, such as VMware Workspace ONE. The MDM system manages all devices owned by the business. Administrators can register the MDM system’s service URL through ABM’s portal. Devices purchased via retail channels can also be manually registered in the ABM system.Bulk Software Purchasing and Distribution Management:In the ABM system, devices purchased by the company are linked to the company’s Managed Apple ID. The company can then purchase software in bulk and manage the allocation and retrieval of software licenses. These licenses belong to the company’s Managed Apple ID, not to any individual employee.Once ABM is in place to manage Apple devices, MDM becomes a standard requirement for enterprise mobile device management. The MDM system will deploy an MDM Profile on each enrolled device, which configures the device with the necessary parameters, installs relevant applications, and sets the device to supervised mode. In this mode, various management policies can be enforced, such as prohibiting the deletion of business apps, setting up app blacklists or whitelists, and ensuring automatic Wi-Fi connection in the company’s network. This supervisory mode cannot be disabled by the user. If a device is lost or stolen, the administrator can remotely lock the device to prevent further use (effectively rendering it unusable).VMware Workspace ONE is currently the best MDM solution for Apple devices on the market. It was named a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Unified Endpoint Management software for two consecutive years (2018-2019). Its predecessor, AirWatch, was named a leader for seven years in a row (2011-2017) in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Mobility Management software, and it has also been repeatedly named a market leader by IDC and Forrester. VMware collaborates closely with Apple to ensure its devices receive timely support, and when Apple releases new operating system versions, Workspace ONE is always prepared and tested in advance to ensure support on the first day of release.Here is a demonstration video of an iPad being automatically deployed under ABM and MDM management (tip: select the “HD 720P” option below the video to watch). After turning on a new iPad, the user is prompted to select the language and country, connect to a Wi-Fi network, and then Workspace ONE takes over. In the demonstration, we can see the iPad being enrolled in the company’s remote management. Workspace ONE automatically configures the iPad, installs the necessary software, and customises the home screen layout according to the company’s style, including removing unnecessary apps, changing the wallpaper, and organising apps into folders. This unified, automated configuration is essential for businesses, as Workspace ONE can configure all Apple devices purchased by the company without requiring administrators or vendors to manually set up each device, significantly reducing the administrative workload.In addition to supporting Apple devices, Workspace ONE also supports Android, Windows 10, Chrome OS, and other types of devices, known as Unified Endpoint Management (UEM). Through Workspace ONE, businesses can manage all their endpoint devices on one platform, which is a key advantage over other vendors.References:vmware - ABM]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[The Difference Between Computer Sleep and Hibernate Modes, and How to Set Up Hibernate]]></title>
      <url>/2025/01-19/01</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[The Difference Between Sleep and Hibernate on Computers, and How to Enable Hibernate1. Reasons to Choose Sleep or HibernateImagine you’re writing a paper, your browser has multiple research tabs open, and you’re working on an unfinished coding project. The day’s work isn’t complete, but you need a break and want to continue tomorrow. If you shut down your computer now, all your progress will be lost. What should you do?Thankfully, your computer offers two handy options: Sleep and Hibernate.By choosing either Sleep or Hibernate, you can resume your work exactly where you left off, ensuring all your data is preserved.But what is the difference between Sleep and Hibernate?2. Key Differences Between Sleep and Hibernate2.1 Data Storage Location      Sleep: Data is stored in the computer’s RAM (memory). The RAM remains powered, while other components are turned off. This means Sleep mode still consumes a small amount of power. If the power source is disconnected, any unsaved data will be lost.        Hibernate: Data is saved to the hard drive, and all components, including the RAM, are powered down. When the system is turned on again, data is restored from the hard drive. Hibernate consumes no power, similar to shutting down the computer.  2.2 Wake-Up Method      Sleep: To wake the computer from Sleep, simply move the mouse or press a key on the keyboard.        Hibernate: To wake the computer from Hibernate, you must press the power button.  2.3 Wake-Up Speed  Sleep mode resumes faster since data is restored directly from RAM.  Hibernate mode takes longer to resume because data is loaded from the hard drive.3. How to Enable Hibernate in WindowsNewly installed Windows systems, whether Windows 7 or Windows 10, come with Sleep enabled by default. However, Hibernate is often disabled. To enable Hibernate, two steps are required:  Run the command to enable Hibernate.  Configure the settings in the operating system interface.To disable Hibernate, simply reverse either of the steps above.Commands to Enable or Disable Hibernate  Enable Hibernate: powercfg.exe /hibernate on  Disable Hibernate: powercfg.exe /hibernate offEnabling Hibernate on Windows SystemsFor a Windows operating system where the Hibernate feature is not displayed, the steps to enable Hibernate are as follows (in C++ pseudocode):1. Press Win+R and enter "powercfg.exe /hibernate on"; // Note: There is a space between "exe" and "/".if (OperationSystem == "Windows 7"){    2. Press Win+R and enter "control"; // This opens the Control Panel.    3. Navigate to "Hardware and Sound".    4. Under "Power Options", select "Change power-saving settings".    5. Choose "Change plan settings".    6. Click on "Change advanced power settings".    7. Expand "Sleep".    8. Set "Allow hybrid sleep" to "Off".    9. Click "OK".}if (OperationSystem == "Windows 10"){    2. Press Win+R and enter "control"; // This opens the Control Panel.    3. Navigate to "Hardware and Sound".    4. Under "Power Options", select "Change what the power button does".    5. Click "Change settings that are currently unavailable".    6. Under "Shutdown settings", check the box for "Hibernate".    7. Click "Save changes".}The accompanying image for the operating system front-end settings is as follows:Step 1: Run the Command  Press Win + R, type powercfg.exe /hibernate on (or powercfg -h on), and press Enter.Step 2: Adjust System Settings  Windows 7:          Press Win + R, type control, and open the Control Panel.      Go to Hardware and Sound &gt; Power Options &gt; Change Plan Settings &gt; Change Advanced Power Settings.      Navigate to Sleep &gt; Allow Hybrid Sleep and set it to Off.      Click OK to save changes.        Windows 10:                  Press Win + R, type control, and open the Control Panel.                    Go to Hardware and Sound &gt; Power Options &gt; Choose what the power button does.                    Click Change settings that are currently unavailable.                    Under Shutdown settings, check the box for Hibernate.                    Click Save Changes.            How to Disable HibernateTo remove the Hibernate option, use the command powercfg.exe /hibernate off (or powercfg -h off) in Step 1. No further action is needed.Visual GuideBelow are visual steps for enabling Hibernate:      Open the Run dialog with Win + R and enter the command powercfg.exe /hibernate on.        Follow the respective settings adjustments for your operating system (Windows 7 or Windows 10) as outlined above.  ]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[  Eliminate subjective emotional factors  Consider multiple possible causes  Identify and establish connections between issues (commonalities)Subjective emotional factors compromise objective analytical judgment and must be eliminated to ensure accurate analysis.RSTNetwork reset due to blocking or issues with hosts IP-DNS mapping.SSL_ERR_SYSCALLAn issue where a manually configured proxy socket for the transport layer causes inaccessibility. It could stem from proxy configuration errors or issues with the URL, which may involve improper hosts mapping settings.AnecdoteA ping test for GitHub revealed that although it couldn’t be pinged, the website was still accessible. For security considerations, the website likely disabled ICMP responses or enabled ICMP filtering.Why Are Some Websites Unreachable via PING but Still Accessible?When you try to ping a website, it shows Request timed out . Four packets are sent, but none are returned, resulting in a 100% packet loss. If it’s unreachable via PING, why is it still accessible?The likely reason is that the website has disabled ICMP responses or enabled ICMP filtering. If ICMP filtering is set, devices not on the whitelist will not receive a response.Disabling ICMP could be based on the following considerations:  ICMP Protocol and Network Security          The ICMP protocol is critically important for network security. However, its characteristics make it susceptible to being used for attacks on routers and hosts within the network.        ICMP Flood Attacks          Continuously sending large amounts of ICMP packets to a target host can overwhelm its system, eventually leading to a crash. Excessive ICMP packets can create an “ICMP storm,” consuming significant CPU resources on the target host to process them.      By disabling ICMP responses, websites can protect themselves against such vulnerabilities and attacks.$ curl -v www.github.com*   Trying 13.250.177.223:80...* Connected to www.github.com (13.250.177.223) port 80 (#0)&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1&gt; Host: www.github.com&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.70.0&gt; Accept: */*&gt;* Recv failure: Connection was reset* Closing connection 0curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection was resetSummaryRST and SSL_ERR_SYSCALL share a common problem: hosts IP-DNS mapping.The application-layer hosts file resolves domain names to specific IP addresses. A proxy merely forwards client requests for these addresses without transforming the IP path. If either the IP or DNS in the hosts file doesn’t exist, access will fail, even with a configured proxy.Since hosts files have higher precedence over remote DNS, the system queries the hosts file for DNS mapping first. If no mapping exists in hosts, it queries remote DNS servers. Although a VPN creates a tunnel for external server access, the DNS mapping sent by the host to external servers remains incorrect, leading to inaccessibility.Even with hosts redirection, temporary access to sites may work due to factors like keep-alive, browser, or system DNS caching.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Before proceeding, you may need to read 《This Book Will Help You Connect to the Internet》 as background knowledge.GitHub DownloadsCopy the following hosts into C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts, and then run the command ipconfig /flushdns to refresh the DNS cache. This host is used to bypass the GFW’s restrictions on GitHub (asw, ssh) downloads and cloning. (Note: This does not eliminate possible server throughput or geographical fiber optic limitations.)If the IP or domain of a host changes and is not updated in time, it may cause connection errors and reset the site’s pointing, making it inaccessible. See GitHub RST and Git SSL_ERR_SYSCALL Comprehensive Analysis for more details.For releases, these may come in compressed formats like zip, 7z, etc., or as software programs like exe or msi.      Visit www.ipaddress.com and look up the DNS resolution for the following links:     github.com assets-cdn.github.com github.global.ssl.fastly.net # Actual download link for raw.githubusercontent.com codeload.github.com            Record the IP addresses found and add them to the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\Hosts file.        Add the AWS host:   219.76.4.4 s3.amazonaws.com 219.76.4.4 github-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com  Run cmd and input ipconfig /flushdns to refresh the system DNS.We can also use jsDelivr CDN to speed up file downloads, or use it to set up an image hosting service with faster access speeds.For a stronger solution, use the Chrome extension “GitHub Acceleration” combined with IDM/FDM.GitHub.io Parsingraw/avatars.githubusercontent.com Cannot ResolveBesides using hosts, you can also configure popular domestic DNS servers for resolution. Since 1.1.1.1 might not always work, domestic DNS servers are preferred.

After continuing, you might encounter a 403 error.Solution: Change the DNS to Yandex, Rostelecom, or Beeline DNS as mentioned above, then run ipconfig /flushdns to refresh the cache. The issue arises because the ISP’s DNS might provide incorrect root certificates, so switching to a third-party DNS with the correct certificates resolves it.Git Clone Slow Speed IssueGit or Terminal Proxy Solutionsgit# Set up proxygit config --global http.proxy 'socks5://127.0.0.1:1080'git config --global https.proxy 'socks5://127.0.0.1:1080'# Remove proxygit config --global --unset https.proxy 'socks5://127.0.0.1:1080'git config --global --unset http.proxy 'socks5://127.0.0.1:1080'mac# mac terminal settingsexport http_proxy="socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"export https_proxy="socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"## Set in .bashrc or .zshrcalias setproxy="export ALL_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"alias unsetproxy="unset ALL_PROXY"openssh# GitHub SSH Configuration## https://help.github.com/articles/using-ssh-over-the-https-port/# HTTP ProxyProxyCommand socat - PROXY:127.0.0.1:%h:%p,proxyport=8848# Socks5 Proxy ProxyCommand nc -v -x 127.0.0.1:1080 %h %pFor reverse proxy acceleration, you can use Static CDN to load images and content:  raw.githubusercontent.com can be replaced by raw.staticdn.net.Environment Package AccelerationpipSince some projects require Python, you can use the following pip download acceleration method: pip install &lt;package_name&gt; -i &lt;mirror_source_address&gt;.For example, to install Jupyter: pip install jupyter - i http://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/Common PyPI mirrors in Russia:  Yandex: https://mirror.yandex.ru/mirrors/pypi/simple/  Moscow State University: http://pypi.mirror.msu.ru/simple/  Rostelecom: Available through regional services but not widely publicized.To set the default mirror permanently:pip install --upgrade pippip config set global.index-url https://mirror.yandex.ru/mirrors/pypi/simple/gemgem sources --remove https://rubygems.org/  # Remove the default sourcegem sources -a https://mirror.yandex.ru/rubygems/  # Add the Yandex mirrornpmnpm config set registry https://mirror.yandex.ru/npm/  # Set Yandex as the npm registrynpm config get registry  # Verify the current registry settingSummaryThe main issues with downloading environment packages are:  Mirror sources  Proxy &amp; VPN, and hosts  Matching versions of packages and libraries]]></content>
